## Business Activities:
---
### **What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**
* N26 is trying to reduce the hassle of traditional banking by eliminating and lowering service fees through providing automation and digitalization of all bank services. They are also trying to shorten the gap of financial freedom for their customers by making it easy and intuitive to set up systems to borrow, save, and spend responsibly.


### **Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**
* N26's intended target audience is your typical banker in the digital age and anyone with a smartphone. Technically the market size for the global banking sector or is 62-69% of the global populus, but if you were to quantify it - they can disrupt a $124 Trillion global banking industry. They also intend to make banking more available to everyone so those percentages will grow.

### **What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**

* N26 offers free checking accounts with no minimal balance required along with a free debit card and no overdraft fees. They're able to do this through massive automation and very little overhead to provide their customers with the same services you receive at a brick and mortar banking branch. They also have a unique savings product known as Spaces, which is comparable to Acorns. The customer can specify to round out their purchases into specific accounts such as a HYS account. You can also triple your remainders to separate accounts designated for vacations or wants or purchase insurance plans. You and a partner can also contribute to a joint vacation fund you're saving up for.

They currently use Python, Node.js, Swift, Amazon EC2, S3, and RDS, Ubuntu, Kafka, and a few others for their data management and scalability as their user base grows.

## Landscape:
---
### **What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**

* Digital banking, also referred to as neobanking, which is strictly mobile banking with no physical branches.

### **What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?**

* Over the past 5-10 years there have been several innovations within, including: Paypal's social media money transerring app - Venmo, Apple Pay, and credit card chips. All of these innovations have paved the way for neobanks to thrive and build off of these tools and services.

* These innovations have led to certain trends such as: easier mobile banking, making spending more liquid, lowering fees, and faster, more secure banking.

### **What are the other major companies in this domain?**
* Nubank 
* Chime
* CashApp
* Paypal/Venmo

## Results
---
### **What has been the business impact of this company so far?**

* In 8 short years, N26 has become one of the largest digital fintech banks in all of Europe and now has over 7 million users in 25 different countries as of December, 2020. The Coronavirus pandemic has also acted as a catalyst to fuel the move to neobanks in our growing remot and digital world. 

### **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**

* Some of the core factors that measure success in this domain are users, valuation, and innovation. Currently, N26 has 7 million+ users across 25 countries, and in 2019 became the most valuable mobile bank in Europe after raising $2.7 Billion and are offering the same services as their direct competitors Nubank, Cash App , and Venmo.

When it comes to the numbers:

Company | Customers | Founded
--------|---------|------------
Paypal / Venmo | 40 M | 2009
Nubank | 34 M | 2013
CashApp | 30 M | 2013
Chime | 12 M | 2013
N26 | 7 M | 2016


### **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**

* N26 is not at the top of its neobank competitors, but it is catching up. Unfortunately, they recently had to discontinue their services in the UK due to Brexit, which is a very large and influential market in Europe. However, their rate of adoption is steadily climbing higher than their competitors 8 years in.

## Recommendations
---
### **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?**

* I think in order for N26 to thrive, they need to introduce all services a traditional bank offers from loans, investments, mortgages, etc. I also think ATM withdrawls from your phone could create a nice marketing buzz. Imagine going to any ATM, scanning your phone or watch as you would for Apple Pay and have it interact with the ATM, refund the $3.00 service fee and dispense your money without having to do a thing. Instant cash. 

* One of their competitors, Avant, offers instant loans up to $25K.

* Last, but not least, with the digital age turning more and more to cryptocurrency, I would suggest they provide banking services in the crypto space as well. This would attract a wealth of new age bankers who are currently involved in the crypto frenzy and as more and more institutional investors and governments begin to legitimize crypto, they will have a major competitive advantage.

### **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**

* It is where the industry is heading; full service mobile banking is the future and you want to target your future audience not just your current. Providing products that will most certainly be standard in the future today will cause major distruption. 

### **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**

* So far, N26 utlizes data science and automation. In order for them to introduce lending, financial advising, roboadvising, and crypto capabilities, they will need heavily invest in blockchain infrastucture, AI, machine learning, and RegTech. 

### **Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**

* In order to be a full service bank, you need to be able to handle everything any normal bank of the future a consumer would assume you can do. This includes: banking, lending, investing, handling multiple currencies, payments and remittances, etc. With this comes regulations and even more security. With the implementation and execution of these technologies, N26 along with its competitors can become a large, global bank of the future.
